# Facebook Marketplace House Renting Post Categorizer

## Overview

This project is designed to categorize house renting posts on Facebook Marketplace into various classes based on features extracted from post images and descriptions. It aims to simplify the search and analysis process for users and researchers interested in the housing rental market on Facebook. The project is divided into three main phases:

### Phase 1: Web Scraping and Feature Extraction

- **Web Scraping**: Collecting renting posts from local Facebook Marketplace groups, with an initial focus on the Queens University/Kingston rental post group.
- **Feature Extraction and Classification**: Developing a model to extract features from the images in the posts and classify them accordingly.
- **Prediction**: Performing predictions on the collected data, which is available in the `data-updated.csv` file.

### Phase 2: Data Management and Interface Development

- **Database Upload**: Uploading the scraped dataset to a MySQL Server for structured storage and easy access.
- **Interface Development**: Creating a website/mobile app to make the data and insights accessible to users.

### Phase 3: Cloud Integration and Real-Time Processing

- **Cloud Deployment**: Uploading the models to a cloud platform to facilitate scalability and accessibility.
- **Real-Time Web Scraping**: Implementing a real-time web scraping feature with an integrated chatbot for dynamic data collection and interaction.
